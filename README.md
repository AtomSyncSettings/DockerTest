# DockerTest
An example use of docker

How to set up very quickly:

1. Download and install docker: https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/ (This is probably the hardest part)
2. Download this git repo, either use:

<code> git clone https://github.com/AtomSyncSettings/DockerTest.git </code>

or [download the zip](https://github.com/AtomSyncSettings/DockerTest/archive/master.zip) & extract it

3. run:

<code> docker build . </code> 

Note: if you run outside the institute comment out line 6 of the Dockerfile

4. You're done! To use the new installation just run:

<code> docker .... </code>

And you are logged in with a working elaxtis and ITK installation!
